I am passionate about crafting seamless digital experiences and building scalable web applications
that solve real-world problems. With over 4 years of hands-on experience as a Full Stack Developer, I
specialize in delivering high-performance solutions using the MERN and MEAN stacks. My expertise
spans across Node.js, Express.js, React, Angular, and MongoDB, along with cloud-native development
on AWS, GCP, and Azure. From developing robust RESTful APIs and real-time messaging systems to
integrating AI features, I thrive at the intersection of innovation and functionality.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve led cross-functional teams, championed clean code practices, and
implemented CI/CD pipelines that accelerated deployment cycles and enhanced system reliability. I
take pride in architecting applications that scale gracefully under high-traffic conditions and mentoring
junior developers to help them grow. Whether contributing to open-source projects or optimizing
backend performance, I bring a problem-solving mindset and a passion for technology that drives
impactful results.

I am currently looking for new ways to advance and contribute to a dynamic organization. Feel free to
contact me if you know of any opportunities that match my skills or if you want to connect.
